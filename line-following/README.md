## Introduction

This is a line following algorithm implementation part. Initially we try to understand what happen in the simulator.

For the testing purporses we used pre build `EPUCK` robot and modify it by converting to basic nodes.

You can easily download the curverd path for line following arena from [Here](https://github.com/AvishkaSandeepa/webots-Autonomous-Mobile-Robot/tree/master/line-following/Arena/line-following-track). Then add this PROTO Node to the PROTO folder of your working directory.

Here is the basic curved path

In addition to that this path contains the world , textures and proto nodes that I used to simulate my line following robot.  It can be found [here.](https://github.com/AvishkaSandeepa/webots-Autonomous-Mobile-Robot/tree/master/line-following/world)
